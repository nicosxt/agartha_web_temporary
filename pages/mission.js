        <h1>Whatâ€™s Regeneration and Why?</h1>
        <h3>A little bit of historyâ€¦</h3>
        <p>Agartha was founded from a study group at a desert commune as â€˜alternative lifestyles to solve societal problemsâ€™. Basically, we resonated on the idea of how unsustainable existing society is, and things we can personally do to change that.
            We can summarize a few existing societal problems into the following:</p>
        <h3>Environmental Crisis ðŸ˜¢</h3>
        <p>With ongoing anthropogenic emissions and chemical pollution, many areas are experiencing unprecedented desertification and loosing biodiversity.
            Weâ€™ve inhabited a beautiful planet but are increasingly making it uninhabitable with unaccounted externalities from over-industrialization.</p>
        <h3>Economical Crisis ðŸ‘¿</h3>
        <p>Rates of societal inequality are higher than theyâ€™ve been in centuries. We live among a global market where inflation is irreversible, organic healthy lifestyles are over-commoditized and extremely expensive, basic housing is mostly unaffordable.
            In the US, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/15/homes/rent-affordability-minimum-wage/index.html">federal minimum wage workers canâ€™t afford the average rent in any major city.</a> Itâ€™s pretty ridiculous isnâ€™t it?</p>
        <h3>Existential Crisis ðŸ¤¯</h3>
        <p>Lifestyles at most city centers are increasingly corporate oriented, stress infused, isolated and unsustainable.
            Rates of homelessness, suicide and drug addictions skyrocket. We are in the midst of a meaning crisis.</p>
        <h3>What can we do?</h3>
        <p>So the question came, what can individuals do about these grandiose, inter-connected societal problems? There is no single answer that can solve all these all at once, if there was, that would be:</p>
        <p className="special-text-bold special-text-italian">Build alternative living spaces that are regenerative environmentally with renewable energy and organic farming, regenerative economically with sustainable financial income, and regenerative emotionally with communal living and mindfulness practices.</p>
        <p>And that is the goal for Agartha. âœŠ</p>
        <h1>The Regenerative Ecosystem</h1>
        <h3>Eco Villages</h3>
        <p>As we start to browse the internet for existing regenerative solutions, we fell into a whole â€˜rabbit holeâ€™ of eco villages!
            Compelling results have already been found about the effectiveness of eco villages in addressing some societal and environmental issues. Of the eco villages in the <a href="https://ecovillage.org/resources/impact-assessment2/">GEN network</a>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>90% have more than 40% women in decision-making bodies</li>
                <li>90% recycle, reuse and repair more than 50% of consumer goods</li>
                <li>85% compost all their food waste</li>
                <li>96% provide training in nonviolent conflict resolution</li>
                <li>80% have an agreed upon method for resolving conflicts</li>
                <li>95% regularly engage in campaigns to protect human rights, the rights of communities and the rights of nature</li>
                <li>All of them actively safeguard regenerative local cultural traditions using local sustainable ways of building and provide education in decision-making and mutual empowerment skills.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We have started putting together a <a href="https://www.notion.so/Regen-Library-c3ca587347594684b3b744bcb0c9f2f0">WIKI of all eco villages</a> for anyone whoâ€™d like to check out these projects!</p>
            <h3>â€˜Solarpunkâ€™ Technologies</h3>
            <p>The idea of â€˜solarpunkâ€™ to summarize, is to use technology in service to mankindâ€™s overall wellbeing, instead of the other way around, which is usually. protrayed in the â€˜cyberpunkâ€™ high-tech future.</p>
            <p>'Technology' as a multi-dimensional concept:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hardware â€” renewable energy solutions, holistic farming, waste upcycle, bio-architecture</li>
                <li>Software â€” open source shared knowledge, decentralized social platforms, permission less record keeping</li>
                <li>Social technology â€” governance, philosophy, coordination skills, communication</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Decentralized Governance</h3>
            <p>We can have all the perfect physical conditions and knowledge to operate a regenerative eco community, and it could fail because of imbalance of power, inter-personal drama, drug abuse, segregation from outside world, inflexible governance systemâ€¦ </p>
            <p>Eco villages have existed at the beginning of human civilization, but it is rare to see eco villages with long lasting governance structures. Governance structure, communication techniques and emotional intelligence are as important as other practical knowledge in shaping the success of eco communal living.</p>
            <h3>Our Approach!âœŠ (aka Roadmap)</h3>
            <p>As stated above, our Northstar goal is to: </p>
            <p class="special-text-bold">Build alternative living spaces that are regenerative environmentally with renewable energy and organic farming, regenerative economically with sustainable financial income, and regenerative emotionally with communal living and mindfulness practices.</p>
            <p>On a more general level, our mission is:</p>
            <p class="special-text-bold">Create Regenerative Culture with Practical Solutions.</p>
            <p>â€˜Regenerative Cultureâ€™ can be a culture to regenerate economically, environmentally and emotionally, it could be a combination of the following: solarpunk lifestyles, permaculture, eco villages, homestead DIY, cultural diversity, mindfulnessâ€¦</p>
            <p>â€˜Practical Solutionsâ€™ include: research & education wiki, strategy games, art & storytelling, tutorials, articles, physical eco villagesâ€¦</p>
            <p>We want to create a space to highlight awesome people and projects in the regenerative space, while provide educational materials such as DIY tutorials & Regen philosophies on the free internet.</p>
            <p>As we proceed with these goals, we are also creating a mission-aligned <a href="https://discord.com/invite/b9v5YM9hwJ">community network</a> to participate in eco-driven initiatives. Through this multi-dimensional approach, create a culture of regenerative living with art, community and technology.</p>
